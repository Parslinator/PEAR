    "\n",
    "    - Added 6 new statistics, bringing the total up to 21. Applied for Week 9 in 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - __v2.2__ - Using spearman correlation against ESPN FPI rather than the SP+ for the optimization weights.  \n",

    "  - __v2.7__ - Updated GR&A's for Beginning of Season Data\n",
